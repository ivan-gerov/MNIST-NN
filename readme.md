# MNIST-NN
---
A simple neural network in Tensorflow and Keras, trained to recognize written diggits from the MNIST dataset. The repository was created in order to train and learn about Neural Networks, TensorFlow and Keras and follows the Chapter 2 of Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron and Deep Learning Basics by SentDex -[Youtube Turorial](https://youtu.be/wQ8BIBpya2k?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfhTox0AjmQ6tvTgMBZBEXN) or [PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/).
